# participant

## Description
Kpt package to apply with participant specific repositories and other setup

## Usage

When you fetch the package, you should give it the name of the particpant. So,
if the participant is 'workshopper', then:

`kpt pkg get https://github.com/nephio-project/one-summit-22-workshop/packages/particpant.git workshopper`

This will pull the package and set up the repository pointers correctly.
